# Power BI Sales Dashboard

This is my first Power BI project, built completely from scratch.

ðŸš€ *Project Summary:*
In this dashboard, I transformed raw Excel data into a clear and interactive report using Power BI.  
I used Power Query to clean and reshape the data, then designed visuals and added slicers for easy filtering.

ðŸŽ¯ *Main Features:*
- Data Cleaning with Power Query
- Interactive visuals (bar chart, cards, pie chart)
- Slicers for dynamic filtering
- Custom background and layout

ðŸ›  *Tools Used:*
- Microsoft Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

ðŸ“Œ *Note:* This is just the beginning of my learning journey in Business Intelligence â€” more projects coming soon!
